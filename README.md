I worked further on the results page making it so that the history of previous test scores is saved and displayed on the final result page after giving multiple quizes. I made a JSON file with an empty array in it and mapped the quizical.ejs file to it to store all the quiz results in the json file. This helped store past quiz results and helped me display the quiz results on the result page. This involved writing reading and writing statement to map to the json file and also working closely with Tim as his and my code were connected by a lot.

Quiz Zone is a fun and easy-to-use quiz platform where users can test their knowledge in categories like Science, Education, Technology, and Computer Science. I worked on the homepage, making it simple and clear so users can log in, sign up, or reset their passwords easily. The homepage also shows the quiz categories with cool icons and hover effects to make it look nice. The signup and reset pages are straightforward and work well on any device.
The backend uses Node.js with Express.js, and we stored user data in a JSON file for now. 

I had an amazing time working on this project with my teammates, Timothy Ng and Aditya Dwivedi. They were great to work with, and we all worked hard to make everything fit together smoothly. This project was a great experience, and Iâ€™m proud of what we built as a team.
